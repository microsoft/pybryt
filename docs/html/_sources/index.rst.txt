   Changelog <https://github.com/microsoft/pybryt/tree/main/CHANGELOG.md>

PyBryt is an open source  Python auto-assessment library for teaching and learning. Our goal is to 
empower students and educators to learn about technology through fun, guided, hands-on content aimed 
at specific learning goals. PyBryt is designed to work with existing autograding solutions and 
workflows such as `Otter Grader`_, `OkPy`_, and `Autolab`_.

Educators and institutions can leverage PyBryt to integrate auto-assessment and
reference models into hands-on lab exercises and assessments. Some of the PyBryt
benefits are:

- Educators do not have to enforce the structure of the solution
- Learners practice algorithm design, code design, and solution implementation
- Learners receive quick and meaningful pedagogical feedback, which substantially contributes to the learning experience
- Complexity of the learner's solution can be analyzed
- Plagiarism detection and support for reference implementations
- Easy integration into existing organizational or institutional grading infrastructure

PyBryt's core auto-assessment behavior operates by comparing a **student's
implementation** of a programming problem to a series of reference
implementations provided by an instructor. A **reference implementation**
defines a pattern of values and conditions on those values expected
to be present in students' implementation. By comparing student's and reference
implementations, PyBryt provides a tailored feedback and advice to the student
on how to bring their implementation closer to the reference one. PyBryt,
instead of only comparing the output of their solution to the reference one,
enables students to reconsider design choices they made and improve their
implementation in incremental steps.

A reference implementation is created by annotating the code written or found by an
instructor and executing this code to create a
:py:class:`ReferenceImplementation<pybryt.ReferenceImplementation>` object.
Annotations are created by creating instances of subclasses of the abstract
:py:class:`Annotation<pybryt.Annotation>` class.
